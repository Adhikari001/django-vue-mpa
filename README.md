This minimal starter application illustrates the fusion of Django and Vue, allowing combined use of both without compromising the strengths and full power of either. With the techniques utilized in the repo, the developer is free to mix Django Templates and Vue throughout an application, using either where most adantageous.

Specifically, the application features:
  * Vue Single File Components (SFCs)
  * Vuex support with preserved state across components and page loads
  * Hot Reloading of Vue components
  * Configurable bundling of Vue JS/CSS resources
  * Support for deferred loading of some or all Vue resources
  * Standard use of Django templating where desired
